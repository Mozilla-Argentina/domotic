Control the electronic devices on your house using Arduino, a JAVA Web Server and JavaScript!

This project makes use of:
* Arduino Uno board*: https://www.arduino.cc/
* 8x White LEDs
* 5x 330 ohm Resistor
* A USB Fan (5V)
* Some cable
* A carefully handcrafted model to put everything on
* Breakoutjs: https://github.com/soundanalogous/Breakout

\*In the picture you can see that there's a WiFi Shield attached on the Arduino, but it was not in use.

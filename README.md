# domotic

Control the electronic devices on your house using Arduino, a JAVA Web Server and JavaScript!

This project makes use of:
* Arduino Uno board*: https://www.arduino.cc/
* 8x White LEDs, in 5 pins
* 5x 330 ohm Resistor
* A USB Fan (5V)
* Some cable
* A carefully handcrafted model to put everything on
* Breakoutjs: https://github.com/soundanalogous/Breakout

The fun part here is that we are using JavaScript, which is a language well known by web developers, to interact with Arduino. This proyect serves as a fundation to what can be done in the field of IoT, Domotic and Home Automation.
Also keep in mind that this was done with very little resources, and can be easily replicated and further developed. The later which we strongly encourage.

\*In the picture you can see that there's a WiFi Shield attached on the Arduino, but it was not in use.
